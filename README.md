# USB_HUB_HR
This project is for a compact USB hub. The hub uses a cable so that it is simpler and more versatile than the ordinary USB hub with a built in cable. The hub has both USB A and USB C ports for more options.
I made this project because I needed a USB hub to plub more peripherals into my PC. I also wanted to learn how USB and USB-C works. I learned a lot such as how to implement the resistors to make USB-C work. This was a farely simple project but I did lots of research on the parts. Additionally I learned about PCBA.
I followed this hackclub tutorial for some information on how to use the main IC. https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/usb-hub
